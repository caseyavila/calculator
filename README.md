## Installtion
Send the `.8xp` file as well as the [C libraries](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases) over to your calculator using either TI Connectâ„¢ CE or TILP

## Building
Use the [CE-Programming's toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain) to build the programs from source. I use LLVM to build and test, so there is a slight chance ZDS II may not compile.
In essence, make sure your `$CEDEV` environment variable is set correctly and run `make` in each program's respective directory.
